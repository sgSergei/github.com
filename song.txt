Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Baby, this love, I'll never let it die
Can't be touched by no one
I'd like to see 'em try
I'm a mad man for your touch, girl, I've lost control
I'm gonna make this last forever, don't tell me it's impossible
'Cause I love you for infinity
(Oh, oh, oh)
I love you for infinity
(Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I love you for infinity
(Oh, oh, oh)
I love you for infinity
(Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, darling, my soul
You know it aches for yours
And you've been filling this hole, since you were born, oh
'Cause you're the reason I believe in fate
